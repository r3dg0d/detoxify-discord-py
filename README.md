# Preface
I plan on making a discord bot which automates removing all toxic content as a whole, and ensuring discord servers have a safe, friendly, and joyful community. Without all the negativity, illegal content, etc. which I have noticed on a few discord servers. As well as an emotional detection tool that detects negative emotions, and cheers the user up with memes.

Coded in either node-js or python and hosted on a VPS.

# detoxify-discord-js
A Discord bot that has a variety of TOS-friendly features for discord servers. 

# Features (WIP)
- Add ping-pong command to test bot in discord client
- Mess around with different data, SPECIFICALLY Research into discord chat logs.
- Train emotional based detection for the data with AI.
- Add a list of negative words that the machine could detect, and act upon based on the data.
- Make the discord bot detect hatespeech, and other related content, and delete it. (using a dictionary of bad words, slurs, etc.)
- Make the discord bot flag the data for mods.
- Add an optional feature where the AI deletes the message and posts something funny like "What he was trying to say, was I need some chicken nuggies" or "Why did the robot cross the road? To learn how to walk... bwahahahaha!"
- Add a built-in URL to virustotal scan in the bot, that scans all URL's for malware, or uses a built-in link list with links to potential malware URL's.
- Add a anti-piracy feature that detects if a link to illegal content from thepiratebay or other piracy websites is detected.
- Detect likelihood of NSFW images and remove them, as well as warn the user why it was removed.
