# Preface
I plan on making a discord bot which automates removing all toxic content as a whole, and ensuring discord servers have a safe, friendly, and joyful community. Without all the negativity, illegal content, etc. which I have noticed on a few discord servers. As well as an emotional detection tool that detects negative emotions, and cheers the user up with memes.

# detoxify-discord-js
A Discord bot that has a variety of TOS-friendly features for discord servers. 

# Features (WIP)
✔️ Make the bot template in python
✔️ Add ping-pong command to test bot in discord client
- Import cerebrum.js to project code
- Mess around with different data in cerebrum
- Train emotional based detection for the data with cerebrum.js
- Add a list of negative words that the machine could detect, and act upon based on the data.
- Make the discord bot detect hatespeech, and other related content, and delete it. (using a dictionary of bad words, slurs, etc.)
- Make the discord bot flag the data for mods.
- Add an optional feature where the AI changes the subject. (What he was trying to say, was I need some chicken nuggies.)
- Add a built-in URL to virustotal scan in the bot, that scans all URL's for malware, or uses a built-in link list with links to potential malware URL's.
- Add a anti-piracy feature that detects if a link to illegal content from thepiratebay or other piracy websites is detected.
