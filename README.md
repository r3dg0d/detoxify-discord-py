# Preface
The internet is the wild west. Anything can happen on here. This is the main reason why most big-tech companies have a TOS (terms-of-service). Some companies (Twitch for instance), are kinda lazy about there TOS. They can't have moderators moderating 24/7 on there platforms. The internet needs an AUTOMATED, easy-to-use AI and Bot to moderate all things TOS related. Otherwise, government will keep bringing big-tech companies into questioning about privacy laws, which, to be fair are pretty fair. 

I plan on making a discord bot which automates all TOS-functions as a whole, and ensuring discord servers have a safe, friendly, and joyful community. Without all the negativity, nudity, etc. which I have noticed on a few discord servers.

# detoxify-discord-js
A Discord bot that has a variety of TOS-friendly features for discord servers. 

# Features (WIP)
✔️ Make the bot template in python
✔️ Add ping-pong command to test bot in discord client
- Import cerebrum.js to project code
- Mess around with different data in cerebrum
- Train emotional based detection for the data with cerebrum.js
- Add a list of negative words that the machine could detect, and act upon based on the data.
- Create a debug mode that tells what emotion the ai detects for each message.
- Make the discord bot detect hatespeech, and other related content, and delete it.
- Make the discord bot flag the data for mods.
- Add an optional feature where the AI changes the subject. (What he was trying to say, was I need some chicken nuggies.)
