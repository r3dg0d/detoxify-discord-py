# Preface
The internet is the wild west. Anything can happen on here. This is the main reason why most big-tech companies have a TOS (terms-of-service). Some companies (Twitch for instance), are kinda lazy about there TOS. They can't have moderators moderating 24/7 on there platforms. The internet needs an AUTOMATED, easy-to-use AI and Bot to moderate all things TOS related. Otherwise, government will keep bringing big-tech companies into questioning about privacy laws, which, to be fair are pretty fair. 

I plan on making a discord bot which automates all TOS-functions as a whole, and ensuring discord servers have a safe, friendly, and joyful community. Without all the negativity, nudity, etc. which I have noticed on a few discord servers.

# detoxify-discord-js
A Discord bot that has a variety of TOS-friendly features for discord servers. 

# Features (WIP)
✔️ Make the bot template in python
✔️ Add ping-pong command to test bot in discord client
- import cerebrum.js to project code
- mess around with different data in cerebrum
- train emotional based detection for the data with cerebrum.js
- add a list of negative words that the machine could detect, and act upon based on the data.
- create a debug mode that tells what the ai detects for each message.
- 
- make the discord bot delete toxic messages
- make the discord bot flag the data for mods.
- add an optional feature where the AI changes the message from toxic to loving, using a database of bad and funny / good words. (nouns, adverbs, adjectives, 
- Add multiple micro-bots (Codename: Illuminati) that run on VPS and record discord calls permanently. They respond to toxic words, nudity, and other TOS-related things in its own manner. 
- Add a voice-to-text model that could recognize speech, convert it to text, use a racism word based model, detect negativity, and confirm that everything is ok. If not, use a text-to-speech model that states what it has detected wrong, and say what happened. (i.e. Racism detected. Please be nice and friendly. Thank you!) or lady liberty route (Virtual Court).

# Notes
Codename: Illuminati and detoxify needs storage for video recordings. Over the course of several years, these recordings could use something called: Big Data. I'd recommend making a home data server, having a lot of storage, or using an NAS (network attached storage). These could be pretty pricey depending on how much storage is needed for the ML, and other code for the software. However once the software is pitched and sold to some big discord servers, it could come out to pay for operating costs.

Repl.it based on my knowledge doesn't allow npm to access the file system, so it is recommended to make an NAS to store all the data on for training.

For security and privacy purposes, cloud storage is not recommended. Local, Home based storage is recommended, or a peer-to-peer option like filecoin is possible. Even then, peer-to-peer has security flaws such as reverse-engineering hardware identifiers on the hard disk, or SSD, unless it is stored as a hash, which makes it harder to bruteforce.

(Note to self: Add source code from repl.it to this github repo.)
